# California Housing Price Prediction

## Project Objective 
The project aims to build a predictive model for housing prices in California based on various property characteristics. The goal is to provide insights into which features most impact house prices and deliver a model that can predict the price of a house based on these attributes. This project will help real estate agencies and buyers make informed decisions regarding property investments.
-   Identify and quantify the top 3-5 factors influencing housing prices in California
-   Develop a regression model to predict housing prices in California with at least 85% accuracy.
-   Design and deploy an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to test the regression model through an intuitive interface.


## Business Problem
The project will answer questions such as:
-   What are the key factors influencing house prices in California?
-   How can we predict house prices with high accuracy using available property data?

The model will help real estate agents and buyers by providing accurate price predictions and identifying critical price-driving features. This can improve market decision-making.
